# How to run the project
Firstly, you need to create the environment and folder on your VS code.

Then you import the calendar module: "import calendar" 

Assign the the aapropriate varaibles, in this case 'mm' for months, 8 for August; 'yy' for year, 2005.

The built-in function month() inside the module takes in the year and the month.

Then you use the appropriate function to display the calendar for that month of the year:  print(calendar.month(yy, mm))

You can change the value of variables yy and mm and run it to test this program for other dates or you copy the link to mine and test run it.
